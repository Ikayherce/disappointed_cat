# Sad Kitty

Sad Kitty is a classic hangman game with a twist. Instead of seeing a dangling man displayed when you guess wrong, you see a cat who is disappointed in you. 
Sad Kitty is my porftolio project 3 for Code Insitute, coded with Python.

## Planning

My plan consisted in designing a simple hangman application with help of the tutorials and project listed in the credits, where the main parts of the code would be the play function and the display function. Later on I decided to add  the logic that would allow the user to choose a level of difficulty (easy, medium or hard).

## UX 
### Program goals 

The goal of this program is to entertain the user with a simple hangman console game, and at the same time amuse with the twist of a sad cat instead of the classic stick figure. By being able to choose a level of difficulty, the user can play the game several times with variation. 

### User stories 
#### The user wants to
- see the introduction text
- see brief instruction
- choose a level of difficulty (easy, medium or hard)
- get feedback on correct and incorrect guesses
- get feedback on when given data is invalid
- get feedback and see the correct word displayed after losing a game
- get feedback when game is won and see word displayed
- get the option to choose whether they want to play again or not 


### Features
#### Existing features
- Welcome message
- Level choice 
- Feedback "invalid data" when user gives invalid input
- Feedback when user replies correctly
- Feedback when user replies incorrectly
- Sad Kitty display
- Feedback for won or lost game
- Option to play again or exit the game

#### Possible future features
 - Adding colors to the design and more forms of visual appeal to the game. 
 - A logo display at the beginning of the game
