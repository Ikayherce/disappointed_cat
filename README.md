# Sad Kitty

Sad Kitty is a classic hangman game but the outcome of losing is not seeing a stickfigure hang, it's instead seeing a cat that is very disappointed in you. 
Sad Kitty is my porftolio project 3 for Code Insitute, coded with Python.

## Planning

I planned a simple hangman application where the main parts of the code are the play function, the display function and the logic that allows the user to choose a level of difficulty (easy, medium or hard) and filters the words in the word list (in a separate file) by level. 

## UX 

### Program goals 

The goal of this program is to entertain the user with a simple hangman console game, and at the same time amuse with the twist of a sad cat instead of the classic stick figure. By being able to choose a level of difficulty, the user can play the game several times with variation. 

### User stories 

#### The user wants to
- see the introduction text
- see brief and clear instructions
- choose a level of difficulty (easy, medium or hard)
- get feedback on correct and incorrect guesses
- get feedback on when given data is invalid
- get feedback and see the correct word displayed after losing a game
- get feedback when game is won and see word displayed
- get the option to choose whether they want to play again or not
